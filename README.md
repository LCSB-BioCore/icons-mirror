# Icons mirror

For the needs of public HTML presentation slides and other things, we often
need various icons and other things that are clumsy to pack with the slides and
their public mirrors tend to be unstable. This repository deploys simple pages
that make a browsable archive of the icons. Currently, this includes only
[twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji), but contents may get expanded
eventually.

You'll find the public listing at https://lcsb-biocore.github.io/icons-mirror/ .
